Created for Torus Biosystems by Jovan Koledin during his 2022 summer internship
AmpFin.py was written to be used if the amplicon for a set sequence and its primers was not given
It takes a text file that contains n number of sequences and associated primers in seq.txt and 
returns the built amplicon and its length, the GC content, and primer distances to a text file named AmpInfo.p3
